## Overview

bloblo stands for **BLO**ckchained micro **BLO**g.

bloblo creates a SNS that does not have a center server, rather than a centralized SNS like Facebook or Twitter.
For this purpose, bloblo is open source, everyone participates in development so that anyone can build a node.

Users can connect at any node once you create an account.
Even if the node that is always logged in dies, user can connect to another node and continue communication.

A node creator can change the UI module.
In other words, you can earn money from bloblo by advertising on the screen of bloblo.
Also, by expanding the message display, it is possible to construct a node with uniqueness.
